So we brought them pizza.” One of the Montero rapper’s crew members offered to bring out boxes of pizza to the cheering fans, but they declined.</p><p>Among the signs held aloft by the demonstrators were the phrases “Jesus is God; even the demons know it” and “Repent and Believe the Gospel.”</p><p>In the middle of the video, which has gone viral with over 1.6 million views in less than 24 hours, the rapper known as Industry Baby revealed some disturbing information.</p><p>But unfortunately one of the homophobes was incredibly hot, he wrote as the camera focused in on a single protester and Sufjan Stevens’s “Mystery of Love” began playing in the background.</p><p>While the protesters politely declined the meal, Lil Nas X (real name: Montero Lamar Hill) shared the same film on Twitter and quipped that he had fallen in love with one of the homophobic protesters.</p><p>In contrast, his ardent supporters jumped to applaud the gentlemanly act and his sense of humor. They wanted that pizza just as much as you did, someone said.</p><p>Another participant joined in to say that this was standard practice in 2011 when Lady Gaga was popular and that it just meant that the performer had made it.</p><p>We love a fantastic, passionate enemies-to-lovers narrative, others said, suggesting the rapper should track down the man in the video. Nas, I have faith in you; go get him!</p><p>Lil Nas X’s MONTERO Call Me By Your Name music video was widely condemned by religious groups when it was released last year. The singer used a stripper pole to enter hell, where he became Satan’s sex slave and performed a lap dance for him. This video directly contradicts Christian teachings against homosexuality.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegp7y1sdKtpqurXayys7GMn5ydZaCex7utjJuwZqSZoXqvrdJmr2ZtY2iAc3%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The 30-year-old said, “I might be incorrect, but I think I mentioned when you asked me a similar question [last time]… I don’t think I’m mature enough to get beyond what’s upset me in that relationship.”</p><p>Though I can’t say for sure that I’ve fully moved on, I’ve certainly matured to the point where it’s possible. Before Malik departed One Direction in 2015, he and Niall had a Twitter fight.</p><p>Even though it was his mother’s dying request, Tomlinson claims he has tried to contact Malik, but the two have apparently not talked since their very public disagreement.</p><p>Since Bigger Than Me’s release, the singer has often wondered how he is doing and secretly hoped everything was fine. However, he admitted that it was challenging. In any case, I hope the best for him. Despite their many differences, Tomlinson still has faith that they can eventually patch things up.</p><p>Over time, he concluded. Given that neither of us has the other’s contact information, I imagine we’ll eventually run into each other. The way forward is through social media.</p><p>The fact that Tomlinson has liked several of Malik’s singing videos on Instagram has led some to speculate that he is trying to mend fences with the 29-year-old.</p><p>Despite Malik’s public disdain for his One Direction output, the singer has recently taken to posting cover versions of the band’s biggest hits on Instagram.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>When pressed on whether he approves of Malik’s viral videos, Tomlinson praised the singer’s abilities, stating that he is “on a whole other level” compared to other artists.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecpMKqv4ytpqakmaPAsLqMoZisZaOprrWxw2aroZmkYrWmecOonKxlnqTBbrLEnqNmqpWWsbp506hkn6einLa3sYyzmLKmXaKurbXKZmxsbGBuf3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The Givenchy creative director — who counts <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> among his biggest fans and closest pals — is fiercely loyal to the members of his inner circle, even when it's not necessarily "cool" to be.</p><p>Asked about his friendships with Kimye and other stars, Tisci told <a href=#>Details</a> that he surrounds himself with people he likes, regardless of their social standing or resume. And he looks for others to do the same.&nbsp;</p><p>"They feel that I'm not there to dress a celebrity. I dress people even when they don't have an Oscar nomination or they don't have an album out," he said. "If they're my friends, I respect them to the end. And you need to feel people stay with you because they love you, not only as an artist, but also as a human being. Look at Kanye and Kim — at the beginning I was the only one."</p><p>The fashion designer went on to say that Kardashian, in particular, was accepted "by nobody" in the fashion community when they first became friends. (The two were introduced by West, who teamed up with Tisci on his Watch the Throne collaboration with <strong>Jay Z</strong>.)</p><p>"She's a sweet girl," the fashion visionary told Details of the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, noting that he and the "Only One" rapper worked to build her up in the industry. "And Kanye and me, we did it together. Every designer is dying to dress her now."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Tisci is one of her personal favorites, though. He created her wedding gown when she married West in Italy last May, as well as her controversial floral gown for the 2013 Met Gala.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Kim's best booty moments</a></p><p>"I didn't care what people thought about Kim," he explained. "In the beginning, I met her because of my respect for Kanye, and then I liked her a lot and we became friends. I got killed because of this. But I didn't care. That is a friend, you see. And that is why, when they got married, they asked me to dress them. They say, 'You've always been with us. You've been a real friend.' If I like somebody, I like somebody. If I don't like somebody, I don't like somebody."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmqq2xnJp8r7HWrGaroZOYrrOwzmaroquTnnqou9NmoqKknJqxbq7EnJiuq5VivKd5yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdllqe2prrDrJ%2BiqF1nfXKBkHJp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

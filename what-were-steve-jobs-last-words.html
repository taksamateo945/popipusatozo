Since then, there has been much speculation about his last words before dying. 
Despite some viral posts found online, Steve Jobs’ last words were about his family, not his accumulated wealth and fame. According to his sister, Jobs’ last words were: “Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.”
Although some claim the Apple mastermind spoke of his fortune and the pitfalls of success just before he passed, Jobs’ final statement was actually a comment about the love he felt from and for his family and is a reflection of how much he cared for them."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He returned to work for awhile but officially <a href=# rel=noopener>resigned</a> from the company he created on August 24, 2011.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jobs’ Death and Final Words</h2><p>Jobs’ health failed rather quickly after his resignation from Apple. He <a href=# rel=noopener>passed</a> away due to complications from pancreatic cancer on October 5, 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Jobs died at his home in Palo Alto, California surrounded by his family. Apple immediately <a href=# rel=noopener>released</a> news of its founder’s passing.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>As part of her eulogy, Steve’s sister Mona Simpson <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> that her brother was looking at his family, his partner, and his children during the last moments of his life.</p><p>Simpson states that his final words as he admired his loved ones were “Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.”</p><p>After speaking his final words, Jobs lost consciousness and died a few hours later. He was buried in a private funeral on October 7, 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple and other <a href=# rel=noopener>businesses</a> across the country paid tribute to Jobs with multiple displays of remembrance.</p><p>Flags in many parts of the country were flown at half-staff and many Apple stores closed briefly for a private memorial service for their founder.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Viral Post Spreads Disinformation</h2><p>Several years after his death, a <a href=# rel=noopener>viral</a> post about Jobs started to spread false information online. The post misattributed a quote to Jobs as his final words.&nbsp;</p><p>In the popular post, Jobs was quoted as saying “aside from work, I have little joy” and “The wealth I have won in my life I cannot bring with me.”</p><p>The post was a statement against materialism and wealth but was never spoken by Jobs and no one in his family ever claimed it was.</p><p>Still, the post became very popular online and was even carried by some media outlets.&nbsp;</p><p>The only final words attributed to Jobs were spoken by his sister during her eulogy. There is no information on who wrote the viral post that became so famous.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Jobs never spoke the attributed statement, he did reveal some misgivings and remorse in his final years.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Speaking</a> with biographer Walter Issacson, Jobs admitted that he wasn’t always there for his children and wished that they knew him better.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdrLKzsYysq56ulWK3sK7SZqOaq6RixLC%2Bw6xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Y&R fans agreed that it was a great scene with excellent acting.</p><p><a href=#>“Nick did the right thing. Great scenes. Phyllis is drunk,</a> depressed, and lonely. It would be a very bad idea to sleep with her in this mental state,” one fan wrote.</p><p>“How much longer do we have to see that piece of misery wallowing in her self-pity? Her gasping, snot running, sobbing, trying to seduce men performances are really stale… She’s long past any sympathy state with her self-pity,” another fan argued.</p><p>What are your thoughts on Nick turning down Phyllis?

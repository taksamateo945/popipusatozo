Read on to see 7 ways Jessie Wynter stays in shape and the photos that prove they work‚Äîand to get beach-ready yourself, don't miss these essential </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><span>30 Best-Ever Celebrity Bathing Suit Photos!</span></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/GettyImages-1474391256.jpg><p><span>Jessie understands that her body changes. "I've gone from religiously working out and being obsessed with what I eat to ACTUALLY living a life. I've been having so much fun eating out with friends, going to events, not revolving my days around a 'healthy lifestyle,'" she said in one of her Instagram posts after gaining weight. "I'm happier, healthier and having more fun than ever. My body definitely looks different but that's okay!"</span></p><p><span>Jessie has been very candid about her body images struggles. "Make your insecurity your strength üí™üèº‚ú® I have spent so long harming and fighting against my body so I could look a certain way. I've tried every fad diet you could think of, spent hours on google trying to find the magic answer, I would do cardio for hours and hours each day- I even quit the job I loved so I could workout more üò£ All of this because I thought there was a problem with the way I looked.. The problem has never been my appearance, it's been my mind," she added in a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>2020 Instagram post</span></a><span>. "I have been trying to heal my relationship with food and my body image for a long time now and feel as though I'm starting to make progress. I still have a long way to go. I'm not necessarily happy with where I am, but I'm happy with how I'm learning to cope with when I feel uncomfortable. I'm working hard to make sure every time I pick out a flaw within myself I back it up with a compliment. I'll look in the mirror and look at the size of my legs- my old reaction would be a breakdown.. Now I appreciate how strong they've become."</span></p><p><span>"One of the best things I did for myself was getting qualified to work in the fitness industry with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>@theaipt</span></a><span> üôåüèº Every day I get to see and help people who are motivated to become the best versions of themselves. Make it happen where it happens and make your move," Jessie captioned a post.</span></p><p><span>Jessie loves hiking and treating herself to a swim in the ocean after. "Wholesome mornings with a spontaneous dip in the ocean," she captioned a post. "Hiking is one of the best ways to get exercise. No matter what type of trail you find yourself on, hiking is a great whole-body workout‚Äîfrom head to toe and everything in between," says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>National Parks Service</span></a><span>. Some of the physical benefits include building stronger muscles and bones, improving your sense of balance, improving your heart health, and decreasing the risk of certain respiratory problems. It also offers many mental health benefits, according to a </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Stanford University</span></a><span> study.&nbsp;</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>Jessie also loves going on walks. Going for a daily walk can be a game changer in terms of exercise, especially at a brisk speed. One study published in </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>JAMA Internal Medicine</span></a><span> found that walking at a brisk pace for about 30 minutes a day led to a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, dementia and death, compared with walking a similar number of steps but at a slower pace.</span></p><p><span>Jessie is devoted to fitness, but sometimes slips away. "After months of feeling out of whack and inconsistently training, I'm on tha grind again," she captioned a post. "Getting restarted after falling out of a fitness routine is so bloody hard. For me, one of the biggest barriers to getting back into it was feeling self conscious about the fact that I wasn't as fit or in shape as I'd been in the past. No one starts at the top. You have to work your way up. Appreciate yourself at your strongest and your weakest because every phase is all part of the journey."</span></p><p><span>Jessie can often be found with a water bottle in hand. According to the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine men should drink about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids a day and women about 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxko52jqLamedaypa2domK2r3nBmquhoZ6cerTByK1krKCRp8BurYycpq6onJZ6tbTRqK6bmZOgerG1wqxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.

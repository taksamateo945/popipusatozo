Speaking with Hello! magazine about her recent nuptials, the 73-year-old “Proud Mary” singer gushes that she has finally found nirvana. “It’s that happiness that people talk about, when you wish for nothing, when you can finally take a deep breath and say, ‘Everything is good,'” she says."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Everything! After 27 years together, <strong>Tina Turner</strong> and music producer <strong>Erwin Bach</strong> tied the knot in a private ceremony in Switzerland — and now, Turner says, life is perfect.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel=noopener>Hello!</a> magazine about her recent nuptials, the 73-year-old “Proud Mary” singer gushes that she has finally found nirvana. “It’s that happiness that people talk about, when you wish for nothing, when you can finally take a deep breath and say, ‘Everything is good,'” she says. “It’s a wonderful place to be.”</p><p>As was her wedding, it seems. Per Hello!, Turner and her longtime love were married in a lavish ceremony at their home on the banks of Lake Zurich, with celebrity guests including <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Oprah Winfrey </strong></a>and <strong>Bryan Adams</strong>. The women in attendance were reportedly asked to wear white, while the men donned black tie.</p><p>Turner, meanwhile, broke from tradition and rocked a stunning black silk tulle and lime-green taffeta gown with Swarovski crystal embellishment. She first spotted the Giorgio Armani frock at a runway show in Beijing, she revealed to Hello!, and she knew immediately she wanted to get it and save it for a special occasion.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I thought, ‘I gotta have that, even if I never wear it,'” the superstar shares. “Then I thought, ‘I know, that will be my wedding dress.'”</p><p>This is the second marriage for Turner, who was previously wed to musician <strong>Ike Turner</strong> from 1962 to 1976. Ike, who died from a cocaine overdose in 2007, often physically abused his wife; she documented their turbulent union in the memoir I, Tina. (The couple’s romance was also the inspiration for the 1993 biopic What’s Love Got to Do With It, starring <strong>Angela Bassett</strong> and <strong>Laurence Fishburne</strong>.)</p><p>Turner, an eight-time Grammy winner, became a Swiss citizen earlier this year. She has two kids: 55-year-old <strong>Craig</strong>, with musician <strong>Raymond Hill</strong>, and 52-year-old <strong>Ronald</strong>, with Ike.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKuippFiwba%2BzZ6pZqeeYrqivtGimKCdXam8brHRsKCnZZKWsKl5yK2qZpldrLyvsMSrna6kXaW5oq%2FEZquoZZKaenN8kGxpb28%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

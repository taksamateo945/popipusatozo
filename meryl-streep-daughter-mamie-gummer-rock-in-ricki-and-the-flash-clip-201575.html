The first trailer for the flick made its way online on Wednesday, May 6, showing Streep, 65, alongside Gummer, 31. This will be the first feature film that gives Gummer a starring role with her mother, while she has made appearances in the Oscar winner’s movies before, including cameos in 1986’s Heartburn, when she was just 2 years old, and 2007’s Evening."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She reunites with her daughter Julie (Gummer), as well as her ex-husband Pete (<strong>Kevin Kline</strong>) and his new wife Maureen (<strong>Audra McDonald</strong>), and son Joshua (<strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>), as the family goes through some inner turmoil.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Absent from her kids’ lives for years, Ricki must reconcile her damaged relationships with the two as she attempts to reconnect with them. Penned by <strong>Diablo Cody</strong> (Juno) and under the direction of <strong>Jonathan Demme</strong> (Philadelphia), Ricki and the Flash also stars <strong>Ben Platt, Rick Springfield</strong>, and <strong>Charlotte Rae</strong>, among others.&nbsp;</p><p>Streep — who previously sang in Into the Woods, Mammi Mia!, and Postcards from the Edge — shows off some impressive singing chops in the first look, whipping her long, braided hair around as she sings Dobie Gray’s 1970s classic “Drift Away.” The celebrated actress also tackles intensely emotional scenes as well, including one in which she is shown breaking down crying during one particularly tough family moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch the trailer for Ricki and the Flash in the video above, and catch the movie in theaters on Aug. 7.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOppyrsZxiwLW%2BxJ6nZpyRqrSpwMSrZKaZnZ6ybrPUpqSeql2nvKS3jKKlZqqZmLiqecCnm2asmJp6p7jArJ9mm5yevW5%2Bj2pscG0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

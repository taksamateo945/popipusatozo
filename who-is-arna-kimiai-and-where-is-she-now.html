Her latest crime is that of identity theft against an oncology nurse named Emily. Arna is set to appear in court for her offenses.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Arna Kimiai’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Arna Kimiai</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> The Uber Bully</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> January 1997</li><li><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Age:</strong> 26 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Persian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Aquarius</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Parents:</strong> Farshad Kimiai (father)</li><li><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 2 inches</li><li><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 157 cm</li><li><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Weight:</strong> 52 kg</li><li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Assaulting and coughing on an Uber driver during COVID 19</li><li><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Instagram:</strong> @foreignskennel</li></ul><h2><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Ethnicity</strong></h2><p>A background check run on Arna Kimiai revealed that the young lady is of Persian ethnicity. For elucidation, Persia refers to a historic extraction of southwestern Asia. It is associated with modern Iran. Arna is listed as an American citizen though her exact place of birth is not known.</p><p>Previously, she was a resident of El Cerrito, Contra Costa County, in California but later moved to LA, where she presently lives. Information about the social media influencer’s date of birth was fished out with a little drama as the authorities didn’t want to publicize it.</p><p>This drove the indefatigable self-appointed social media investigators into action; they eventually dug up the IG post she shared on 29th January 2021, thanking fans for their birthday wishes. The post in itself is a blatant confirmation that Arna Kimiai is an Aquarius, and her year of birth was later revealed as 1997.</p><p>Arna has kept mute about her academic journey, which has made it impossible to know the level she reached in education. Besides, the academic institutions she favored have never earned a public mention.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Arna Kimiai’s Father?</strong></h3><p>The name of Arna’s father has been revealed to be Farshad Kimiai – a man of Persian origin who currently reside in the Californian part of the United States. Farshad is a businessman and takes credit for establishing Arna Enterprises, Inc.</p><p>Though we were not intimated about the kind of business Arna Enterprises, Inc. is into, reports revealed that its office is located in Richmond, and the incorporation date for the company is the 6th of August 1998.</p><p>With that said, we must also acknowledge that Arna Enterprises, Inc. is now defunct. The US authorities suspended the company in 2016 following Farshad Kimiai’s arrest on charges of sexual battery in El Cerrito.</p><h2><strong>What Does Arna Kimiai Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Arna Kimiai is a social media star with accounts on various platforms like Facebook, Tiktok, Twitter, Snapchat, and YouTube. However, she deactivated all her channels after her unpalatable incident with an Uber driver.</p><h2><strong>The Event That brought her To Public Attention</strong></h2><p>On the 7th of March 2021, around 12:45 p.m., an SF Bay Area Uber driver named Subhakar Khadka (Khadka is an immigrant from Nepal) picked up three female passengers. This happened in San Francisco, precisely at San Bruno Avenue.</p><p>The three ladies came dressed in varying colors of black, red, and yellow, and the lady in black wasn’t wearing a mask; her name is Arna Kimiai. The red-clothed lady’s name was later revealed as Malaysia King, and the other person in yellow remained unidentified to date.</p><p>Considering the safety measures from the then ravaging Corona Virus pandemic, Khadka respectfully asked Arna to wear a mask. After she refused, he canceled their ride as Arna’s behavior went against Uber’s rider policy that says every passenger must board their vehicle wearing a mask.</p><p>They were already partway through the ride when the altercation occurred. The driver’s decision provoked violent reactions from Arna Kimiai and her co-passengers. Still, Arna took it to the extreme when she coughed on Khadka, attempting to tear off his mask, and grabbed the driver’s mobile phone, which was lying on the center dash area.</p><p>Arna was still confronting Khadka when her friend, Malaysia King, pepper-sprayed him into the back seat of his cab. Even when the helpless driver managed to shoo the crazy girls out of his cab, Malaysia gave him one last pepper spray through the partially open car window.</p><p>Besides, they all seemed less concerned by the fact that there was a dash-mounted camera recording the whole incident in the car. This incident earned Arna the unpalatable moniker – “The Uber Bully Girl.”</p><h3><strong>Was The Uber Bully Girl Arrested?</strong></h3><p>The Uber driver, Khadka, wasted no time in sharing the video of his confrontation with Arna Kimiai and her clique, and within just one week, it went viral on the internet. The viral video led the Los Angeles cops to arrest Arna.</p><p>Reports said she was the one who surrendered herself to the authorities. “The Uber Bully Girl” presented herself at the San Francisco Women’s Jail around 7:00 p.m. on the 14th of March 2021, where she received four–counts charges.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Arna Kimiai Wiki – Arna Kimiai Biography<br>Arna Kimiai, who was dubbed the “Uber Bully” on social media platforms, surrendered to San Francisco police on Sunday night, March 14.<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/lwlr67qNyu</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pVEdW3XlJ9</a></p><p>— Wikibioin (@wikibioin) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">March 17, 2021</a></p><p>The pepper sprayer Malaysia King was also caught by the Loss Angeles Police a few days down the line and slammed with charges of alleged bank fraud. In addition to the bank fraud, King was also accused of assault with caustic chemicals, including conspiracy charges for her link to the Uber driver’s incident.</p><h3><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Hearing</strong></h3><p>When she was eventually arraigned in court, Arna Kimiai pleaded not guilty to all the charges leveled against her, including:</p><ul><li>243,3PC/M- battery committed against a driver or operator. Punishable by a fine of $10,000 and/or a one-year jail term.</li><li>120295HS/M- violation of laid down local health ordinance. This is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and/or a 90-day jail term.</li><li>664211PC/F- attempted robbery. This is punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and/or five years imprisonment.</li><li>After all these, the police added a misdemeanor count of battery to Arna’s felonies.</li></ul><p>Arna Kimiai was later released on April 2021 on a bail of $75,000; a formal trial was slated for the 14th of October 2021. Reports said she posted bond on the 15th of March 2021.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>On TMZ: Maskless Uber Rider Arna Kimiai Surrenders to Cops, Hit with 4 Charges <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Kfa0pV5iaS</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ma8TIRO2GD</a></p><p>— What's Cool (@WhatsCool) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">March 16, 2021</a></p><h3><strong>Arna’s&nbsp; Reaction to Khadka’s Video</strong></h3><p>After she was freed from detention, Arna Kimiai attempted to clear her name of all blame by deciding to respond to Subhakar Khadka’s video. She previously deactivated her IG handle @keepinupwforeign, but she reactivated it to go on Instagram Live.</p><p>At the onset, she described her actions as disrespectful and said she was dead-ass wrong, but she also laid part of the blame on the driver.&nbsp;Blaming the Uber driver, Arna claimed the man brought it on himself by attempting to drop them in what she referred to as the middle of nowhere.</p><p>In her live video, Arna threatened to sue the transport company Uber and ended it by saying, “That’s why I take Lyft.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bb girl really said “I’m an entire dumpster fire of trash but while I’m here, lemme get some followers” <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1WLjRNR04r</a></p><p>— Taylor Cardace (@TaylorCardace) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">March 9, 2021</a></p><p>A few days later, on the 9th of March 2021, Lyft responded to “The Uber Bully Girl’s” claims that she loves using their services; they put out an announcement banning Arna Kimiai from their services. That same day, Arna locked up her IG handle and has not opened it again.</p><h3><strong>The Reaction of the Public to Arna Kimiai’s Behavior</strong></h3><p>The general public condemned Arna Kimiai’s action against the Nepal-born Uber driver. Besides, being forced to come under the spotlight by the egregious actions of Arna and her clique heralded good things for the poor driver.</p><p>Within a short while, people decided to commence a GoFundMe on Khadka’s behalf, and before the end of April, they were able to garner $106,216. The GFM was organized by Cyan Bannister, who came out to make the announcement on how much was realized.</p><p>Recall that Arna is a social media star, with companies giving her lucrative advertising gigs. All her ads came to a stop as those brands distanced themselves from her. This was exactly what crushed her internet career.</p><h2><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Arrest Record</strong></h2><p>People initially thought that the assault of the Uber driver was Arna Kimiai’s first demeanor, but that is very far from the truth. The internet star has had several brushes with the authorities and has gone in for her crimes on several occasions. Here is a rundown of her major offenses</p><h3><strong>Arna Was Arrested For Battery In LA</strong></h3><p>Arna’s crime record started building up as far back as 2015 when she was arrested in LA on the 14th of July. The internet sensation’s offense was a battery on a person but was soon settled.</p><h3><strong>Arna Kimiai’s Sued For Negligent Driving</strong></h3><p>Before the incident with the Uber driver, Arna battled a civil suit. A woman went to the LA court in February 2021 to accuse her of negligent driving. Arna made an unsafe turn, resulting in the woman’s automobile getting hit.</p><h3><strong>Kimiai Filmed Herself While Going 122 MPH</strong></h3><p>Arna Kimiai further incriminated herself when she decided to share a throwback June 2020 video where she was seen hitting 122 MPH; this happened in a McLaren on the freeway.</p><p>Arna pointed her smartphone at the automobile’s digital speedo to prove her triple-digit malfeasance. Still, it should also be noted that the use of a smartphone while driving is an offense in itself. California’s distracted driving laws frown against it, which became another recorded offense for the social media personality.</p><h3><strong>Arna Kimiai Was Arrested For Disorderly Conduct</strong></h3><p>From what is glaring, Arna Kimiai can’t afford to stay away from trouble. Smartphone footage made the rounds on the internet, where Arna Kimiai was spotted trying to run away from the LA cops. The reason she was on the run was later revealed, and it turned out that the internet star tried to assault some bystanders on the 3rd of June 2021. The authorities later arrested her for disorderly conduct.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">What happened to Arna Kimiai, the woman who coughed on & assaulted SF Bay Area Uber driver over face mask?</a></p><h3><strong>Arrested for Appearing Topless</strong></h3><p>While she was trying to defend her actions against the Uber driver through her IG Live video, Arna <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>appeared topless</a>. The bizarre IG video led to another arrest for assault. Her words in the video, “all I did was take his mask off, cough a little, but I don’t even have COVID-19,” made her even more notorious.</p><h3><strong>Arrested For Burglary</strong></h3><p>On the 12th of February 2020, the Orange County Sheriff’s Department arrested Arna for burglary. The details of this case were not made public, but it did happen.</p><h3><strong>Arrested For Taking an Automobile Without the Consent of the Owner</strong></h3><p>The list of Arna Kimiai’s demeanor seems endless; on the 16th of July 2020, the female social media personality went in for another crime. This time, she didn’t bother to let the vehicle owner know before taking it out.</p><h3><strong>Her Latest Brush With The Authorities Has to do with Identity Theft</strong></h3><p>Arna Kimiai is currently <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>facing charges of identity theft</a> in Miami. Reports said the Persian lady stole the identity of an oncology nurse who works in San Francisco; this happened around April 2022. The nurse who was called Emily was Arna’s next-door neighbor last fall.</p><p>Kimiai allegedly rented a penthouse under the nurse’s name and went ahead to set up a new account with a power company in Florida using her identity. Nurse Emily who requested that her last name be concealed, went to file a police report after suspecting that her identity was being used by Kimiai.</p><p>Emily said she suddenly started getting Chase inquiries, and there were 12 of them. Knowing she wasn’t the one transacting, the oncology nurse started digging to unravel the mystery. She followed up with all the establishments where her credit was run without her knowledge, including car dealerships and luxury buildings.</p><p>She was lucky to get the phone number of the person who was behind the transactions, and when she ran a check on the cellphone number, it threw up Arna Kimiai’s name. She didn’t recognize the name initially and went to google it only to come up with many things.</p><p>The viral cough video first caught Emily’s attention, but it wasn’t long before she recognized Arna as the lady who lived next door to her in September while she was residing in Los Angeles.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Remember this vid I broke of 3 women yelling slurs, taunting & grabbing Uber driver Subhakar’s phone?</p><p>Arna Kimiai who coughed on him, now accused of stealing an SF nurse's identity. Miami PD have a warrant out for her arrest. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@MelanieWoodrow</a>’s piece: <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/TBwkEpfvJ9</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/RPUYCzdStH</a></p><p>— Dion Lim (@DionLimTV) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">April 28, 2022</a></p><p>According to the oncology nurse, it was baffling to find out that Kimiai was the one targeting her; while they were living as neighbors, they never exchanged more than a head node when they met in the hallway, Emily said. Perhaps she stole some of her emails while they were living next to each other and started this scheme, she concluded.</p><p>The oncology nurse filed reports with US Postal Inspection Service, Miami PD, and SFPD detailing her claims. When sources reached out to Arna’s attorney, Seth Morris, he responded that he had already communicated to his client, and she was ready to surrender herself in Miami.</p><p>This led to Arna’s most recent arrest, where she is facing charges of an organized scheme to defraud, grand theft, and fraudulent use of personal information.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Arna Kimiai, who coughed on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@Uber</a> driver & is now accused of stealing SF nurse’s identity turned herself in to Miami PD @ 8:20p Wed, hour after I-Team piece aired.

According to the attorney, his client has already surrendered herself to the authorities and has already been booked.</p><p>She was processing her bail, which was going to be effective the same day.&nbsp;No further reports have come from Morris, but to the best of our knowledge, Arna is still a resident of California and is patiently awaiting her trial.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmaZoqOubrfIpqCaoV2Wu6V51qGcq51dnsBuv8eeZKenp2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

It’s usually an honor to reign supreme in a particular musical genre.

Still, rapper&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LL Cool J</a></strong>&nbsp;doesn’t agree after learning that social media deemed him the forefather of pop rap. The world was introduced to the Queens, New York, native in the early ’80s with hit songs such as “Mama Said Knock You Out” and “I’m Bad.” Before Drake’s melodic rap flow, there was LL, whose real name is James Todd Smith, singing about sitting alone in his room listening to the words of conscience telling him he needs love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1151032807-600x450.jpg><p>Still, LL remained confused by his title and recently took to his Twitter account seeking some clarification. “Me being called the forefather of pop rap is very confusing,” the 53-year-old wrote. “What the f–k are you talking about ?? LOL.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me being called the forefather of pop rap is very confusing.

I Need Love, I’m Bad, Rock the Bell, I’m going back to Cali, Doing it. Yes it was Popular Raps because it was just RAP.” They added, “Wasnt gangster, mafioso, trap or street introvert. If was just popular.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Popular Raps, Yes..

In the back of their minds they maybe heard their conscience call. Just spitballing. 4321 reasons why they are wrong.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Probably home in their rooms, staring at the wall.

Fans expressed that his career shouldn’t be defined under just pop rap, including one user who wrote, “Only someone who chooses to be willfully ignorant of the culture and its history would even dare say something like that.” That person added, “Spectacular vernacular miraculous raw shyt scooped off the concrete make a hit. That’s pop-rap? Fuggedaboutit.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Only someone who chooses to be willfully ignorant of the culture and its history would even dare say something like that.

In my opinion, that doesnt diminish what u did to pioneer Hip Hop.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I aint wit that Unc.<br>Hip Hop innovator.<br>Its not a crime or a strike against u for reaching over to get some other money….

He is arguably one of the first rappers to successfully cross over from the music industry to create an illustrious acting career.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49tZmpsX6i8pLXApWSmnZSerm6wxJ%2Bcp5yjYrmtecKopqVlmmKup8DEq2ShnaNiuaKuxKWcnWWknbJuss6rnJ%2BZpJ2ys3nOn2Spp6Biv6K8jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

They <b>poo out of a hole</b>, called an â€˜anusâ€™, in their bottoms; and wee using a different hole. â€¦ Well, since a mermaid has a human top half and a fishy bottom half, I think she would poo through a vent on her tail. This would mean that she would make stringy poo like a fish.</p><p>How do I find a mermaid?

Then the females bite on to their male mateâ€™s necks and smack them with their tails. Ryn later states that males can even die from excessive mating.</p><p>What would a mermaid eat? In this fairy tale, mermaids eat <b>fish, sea vegetables and a dash of fat</b> (following the Zone Diet, of course), which is how they get their healthy and youthful appearance. As it turns out, seaweed, a primary vegetable in their diet, has numerous health benefits that could help you embrace your inner mermaid.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_mermaids_pee></span>Do mermaids pee?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mermaids are indeed monotremes.

Though <b>it is possible for mermaids to get pregnant</b> and give live birth like dolphins.</p><p>How would a mermaid pee? [TL;DR: Ariel <b>pees out of her belly button</b>.] Well now, letâ€™s see. Since their tails are generally depicted or specified as that of a fish, not of a marine mammal, my first thought was that they would pass both waste and reproductive cells through a cloaca of some description.</p><p>Who was the first mermaid?</p><p>The earliest mermaid-like figure was likely <b>the ancient Syrian goddess Atargatis</b>, who watched over the fertility of her people, as well as their general well-being. She, too, was human above the waist and fish below it, and was accordingly associated with water.</p><p>How long does a mermaid live?

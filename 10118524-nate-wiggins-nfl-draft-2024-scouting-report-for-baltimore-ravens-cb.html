The foundation "focuses on building a better future through mentorship and support for local organizations."</p><p>Nate Wiggins is a long, rangy cornerback who started for Clemson over the last two seasons. The 4-star prospect was able to work his way onto the special teams unit for Clemson as a freshman before becoming a starter as a sophomore.</p><p>Wiggins is versatile enough to play in both man and zone schemes, as he has the ability to play from press and off coverage. One of the premier cornerbacks in the ACC, he was selected first-team All-ACC in both the 2022 and 2023 seasons by various outlets.</p><p>Wiggins does a very good job of using his length in coverage. When in press, he uses his hands well to control and redirect receivers off the line of scrimmage. He's able to seamlessly open and run thanks to his fluid hips, and he has the ability to quickly sink his hips and transition out of breaks. He can be a bit lazy at times with his pad level, causing him to round breaks or be slower to drive on the ball, but when done correctly, he has the footwork to burst out of breaks and drive on receivers.</p><p>When working down the field, he has the speed to run with receivers, although he is inconsistent with his positioning. He does have top-notch recovery speed to get back into phase. Wiggins often relies on face-guarding downfield and playing through the hands of receivers. When the ball is in front of him, he has the ball skills and timing to break up passes.</p><p>As a run defender, Wiggins does just enough. He isn't afraid of getting in the mix, but he's more than willing to let others make the tackle before him. He often looks to get around blocks with speed and finesse due to his lack of strength and physicality in the run game. Wiggins is willing to come up and support the run, but he's inconsistent with his tackling, often diving at ball-carriers and melting off his tackles.</p><p>Wiggins' versatility in the pass game is what ultimately drives his value up. His length and ability to run make him one of the top cornerbacks in this year's class. He has the frame to continue to add weight, and with time and maturity, he should improve his play strength. Wiggins has the ability to be a starter in the NFL, but he will need to continue to improve his technique early on in his career.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 7.5 (Potential Impact Player- 2nd Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 34</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: CB5</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Cordale Flott</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW2Cc4CMp5itnV2stqizyKeqZqaWoXqlvsCfq2ZqYGeBbr%2FCqKytoZ6cerOxz6iprWWWpL9ursClq6Kln6eybr7Ar5ynq12Yrw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

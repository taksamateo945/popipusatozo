In a quote taken from IMDB, Spielberg states, “I don’t drink coffee. I’ve never had a cup of coffee in my entire life. That’s something you probably don’t know about me. I’ve hated the taste since I was a kid.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62702 alt="Still from Citizen Kane" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Steven-spielberg-facts-rosebud-sled1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-62702 class=wp-caption-text>Still from Citizen Kane.

Let’s call it what it is. I didn’t take a single dollar from the profits I received from <a href=# rel=noopener>Schindler’s List</a> because I did consider it blood money.” He instead has donated any profits from the film due to him to the <a href=#>Shoah Foundation</a>.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Steven Spielberg Facts Bond" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/steven-spielberg-facts-bond.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Albert R. Broccoli has been producing films in the James Bond franchise for many years. Early in his career Spielberg approached the producer about directing a James Bond film but was told he needed to get more experience. Shortly after releasing <a href=# rel=noopener>Schindler’s List</a>, Spielberg tried again. This time he was told, “Now I can’t afford you.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Steven Spielberg Facts Oscars" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/steven-spielberg-facts-oscars.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In an effort to help the Academy preserve film history, Steven Spielberg purchased and then re-donated Clark Gable’s 1934 Best Actor Oscar for It Happened One Night, and Bette Davis’ Best Actress Oscars for Dangerous (1935) and Jezebel (1938). Spielberg spent $1,365,500 on the three historic trophies.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62707 alt="Star Wars" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Steven-Spielberg-facts-star1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-62707 class=wp-caption-text>Image Source: Wikipedia</p><p>Ranking at no. 164 on the Forbes 400 list of America’s richest people, Spielberg has a current estimated net worth of $3.6 billion.</p><p>Not only has he directed some of the highest-grossing movies ever made, he has also made shrewd decisions when it comes to financial structuring. With all three original Jurassic Park movies, he took points on the back end – leading to a payout of $250 million on the first film alone. Spielberg also receives 2.5% of the proceeds from the Star Wars films, thanks to a deal he made a long time ago with good friend George Lucas.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62689 alt="On The Set Of E.T.

Later, when Barrymore famously posed for Playboy magazine, Spielberg sent her a package containing a quilt and a note telling her she needed to “cover up.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62699 alt="Steven Spielberg Facts Pg13" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/steven-spielberg-facts-pg13.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-62699 class=wp-caption-text>Image Source: Wikipedia</p><p>After some of his films such as Gremlins and Indiana Jones came under fire for scenes considered to be too scary for children, Spielberg suggested to Motion Picture Association of America president Jack Valenti that there be a rating falling between PG and R. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Spielberg said, “I suggested, ‘Let’s call it PG-13 or PG-14, depending on how you want to design the slide rule,’ and Jack came back to me and said, ‘We’ve determined that PG-13 would be the right age for that temperature of movie.’”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62706 alt="Steven Spielberg Facts Speaker" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Steven-Spielberg-facts-speaker1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-62706 class=wp-caption-text>Image Source: Wikimedia Commons</p><p>For many years Steven Spielberg suffered from an un-diagnosed learning disability which made it difficult for him to learn to read, making him an easy bullying target by classmates. His difficulties reading were often incorrectly attributed to laziness, and the director would not be diagnosed as having dyslexia until he was 60 years old.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62693 alt="Steven Spielberg Facts Dog" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/steven-spielberg-facts-dog.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-62693 class=wp-caption-text>Image Source: Flickr</p><p>Steven’s pet cocker spaniel Elmer appeared in many of his films – including Close Encounters of the Third Kind, The Sugarland Express, 1941, and Jaws.

The 1989 divorce settlement is considered one of the costliest in American history.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62695 alt="Steven Spielberg's Father" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Steven-Spielberg-facts-father1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-62695 class=wp-caption-text>Image Source: Romain Dubois</p><p>They are: Max Spielberg (from his first marriage to Amy Irvin); Jessica Capshaw (current wife Kate Capshaw’s daughter from a previous marriage); Theo Spielberg (adopted by Kate Capshaw, later adopted by Spielberg); Sasha Spielberg (with Kate Capshaw); Sawyer Spielberg (with Kate Capshaw); George Mikaela Spielberg (adopted with Kate Capshaw), and Destry Allen Spielberg (with Kate Capshaw).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-62694 alt="Eagle Scout" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Steven-Spielberg-facts-Eagle-Scout1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-62694 class=wp-caption-text>Image Source: Creative Commons</p><p>Possibly the most famous Boy Scout of all time, Spielberg had the drive and determination to climb to the highest level of the organization, Eagle Scout. However, in 2001 he resigned – due to the group’s long history of bigotry.</p><p>In a prepared statement given at his resignation, Spielberg said, “It’s a real shame, I thought the Boy Scouts stood for equal opportunity and I have consistently spoken out publicly and privately against intolerance and discrimination based on ethnic, religious, racial and sexual orientation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0wMSvnKdlo6W2prjBnqmgZZaWsLW%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

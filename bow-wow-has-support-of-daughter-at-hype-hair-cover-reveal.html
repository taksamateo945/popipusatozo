It has to be organic,” Bow Wow said of <a href=#>his latest business venture</a>. “Everybody knows I’ve had braids since I was a little boy. And we know how much durags means to us and how important it is to the culture. So I had to be the first person to get on,” he added.</p><p>In many ways, Bow Wow’s hair served as his signature. Music lovers looked for the little boy with braids who had incredible rap lyrics when Shad was younger. Some were devastated when the recording artist decided to cut his hair and ditch the braids in his young adult years. Moss has returned to a variation of the hairstyle in recent years, which is one reason why he was so excited to partner with KISS Colors & Care to create his hair accessories line. Shai also benefits from her father’s new business venture.</p><p></p><p>“She’s probably the main reason why I have half a box of durags now,” Bow Wow recently told <a href=#>the press</a> when asked if his daughter wears his luxe durag line. “Absolutely,” <a href=# rel=noopener>he added</a>. “When she wears them, she looks just like me when I was 13—especially when she has long box braids and braids straight to the back,” Bow Wow said.</p><p>Shai is a part of her father’s motivation to keep inventing. “My family,” Bow Wow said when asked about his inspirations during the Hype Hair event. “You hear everybody say that but really it’s just the family. It’s my mom, my kids. That’s the things that just keep me with the drive and the passion to do what I do each and every day.”</p><p>Learn more about Bow Wow’s <a href=#>hair accessories</a> line <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>!</p><p>Photo: Getty Images</p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span><br><span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span><br><span class=post-views-count>144</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOm6awZaekxG60wKxkrK2gpbyzwIyonWackaq0qcDEq2SarF2dxrGxjKGYoqpdmLy3sdFmqZ6ulZa5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

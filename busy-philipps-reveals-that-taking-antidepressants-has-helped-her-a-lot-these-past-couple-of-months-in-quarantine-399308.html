The enormity of the situation’s felt crushing and hard and difficult to get through. I needed extra help.

Right now, there are so many mental health organizations offering extra help for free and people who feel that thing need to be able to know that it is okay to reach out. I know I speak from a place of privilege, but by sharing it on social media, I want people who are feeling&nbsp; the enormity of it or just can’t stop crying to know that there are ways that you can get help, too.’</p><p>But the pills are not the only things helping with her mental health.</p><p>She mentioned that helping out others during this pandemic has also been something to ground her and keep her focused on something important.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>And finally, being with her kids at home is also a huge help.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSqsC6ec%2BhoKWhoKXAbr7Er5yapKNiwamt02armqOZo7Rurc2toJ2doKeytL%2FAp6usZZiWwG60xKWnnpxdnbKzecBmo6isXam1pr%2FEZqeaq6RisLDBz6WcZqeWYrqwutOhqmahnmK%2Btq3RmqWtoZ6aenSFmGxncWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

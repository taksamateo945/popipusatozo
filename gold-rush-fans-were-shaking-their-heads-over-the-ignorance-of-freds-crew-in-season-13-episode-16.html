Complete and utter muppets.” “Fred’s crew are idiots,” echoed u/BobtheReplier. U/PrestonTheCat24 observed that they were screaming at the television for somebody to check the pulleys in the washplant, and found the incompetence regarding the snapped belts to be extremely cringeworthy.</p><p dir=ltr>Although much of the criticism regarding Lewis and his crew appears to be blown out of proportion, this particular incident is certainly one to note — not only because of how it set Lewis’ crew back but because of the inherent danger of mishandling this dangerous machinery. In any case, it’s clear that the criticism of Lewis’ crew was well-deserved, and they ought to be more cautious with their machinery in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cLPOpZtmqqWotW6ywKeqZq%2BVp7Juv8eaoqKml2LBqbHIq2ShnZGZwG671Z6pZqyYmnqqs82oqZqmk5p6sLKMn6menKNisLOx1magp2Wjmq60u81maGxllaW2tLvDnmRqbl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

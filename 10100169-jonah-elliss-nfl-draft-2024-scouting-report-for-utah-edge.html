— Pretty quick off the ball with good acceleration off the line of scrimmage.
— Sets up his pass-rush moves well by getting square on the offensive tackle and using a Eurostep to get to the outside.
— Has shown a handful of pass-rush moves he can win with around the edge like a rip move and hand swipe to go along with a nice inside spin move as a counter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Won't turn a ton of tight corners as a pass-rusher at the next level.</p><p>— Pad level and lower-body strength are subpar, which impacts his ability to set the edge against the run, especially against better competition.</p><p>—Injuries over the last two years are starting to mount.</p><p><b>2023 STATISTICS</b></p><p>— 10 G, 37 TOT, 16.0 TFL, 12.0 SK, 3 PD, 1 FF</p><p>— Born Apr. 3, 2003</p><p>— 3-star recruit in 2021 class, per <a href=# rel=noopener>247Sports</a></p><p>— Injuries: 2023 (Undisclosed, season-ending, missed 3 games), 2022 (Undisclosed, missed 2 games; Non-football injury, missed spring practices)</p><p>— Father, Luther, had a 10-year NFL career and was a two-time Pro Bowler; brother, Kaden, is currently a linebacker for the Atlanta Falcons; brother, Christian, is currently a linebacker for the New England Patriots; brother, Noah, is currently a defensive tackle on the Philadelphia Eagles practice squad</p><p>After serving as more of a rotational player last season, Jonah Elliss earned a starting job during training camp this summer and burst onto the scene as a pass-rusher. He was highly productive this season and has several moves he can win with, showing some nuance as a rusher and the ability to defeat tackles with both power and finesse.</p><p>Ellis sets up his pass-rush move well during the stem phase of the rush by getting square to sell the bull rush so offensive tackles stop their feet and then using a Eurostep to win around the edge. He also flashes hands to get tackles to throw their punch early and has an impressive inside spin move as a counter.</p><p>Elliss' biggest flaw as a rusher is that he has only average bend to turn a tight corner at the top of the rush. That could be a bigger issue in the NFL, but it's not as if he's terrible in this area and the problem can't be fixed.</p><p>Against the run, Elliss is physical at the point of attack and has long arms to help get extension. However, his lower body appears to be a little weak, as he struggles to set the edge against better competition/tackles. He has a top-heavy frame, as his legs are kind of wiry compared to the rest of his body.</p><p>Overall, the 20-year-old can contribute as a pass-rusher right away and could develop into at least a serviceable run defender. Schematically, he'd currently be best as a standup outside linebacker in odd fronts.</p><p><b>GRADE:</b> 7.2 (High-Level Backup/Potential Starter — 3rd Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK:</b> 60</p><p><b>POSITION RANK:</b> EDGE6</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON:</b> Alex Highsmith</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGV%2Bd4WMo6anmZhisq24yKyqZqaWoXqlvsCfq2ZqYGeBbr%2FCqKytoZ6cerOxz6iprWWWpL9uwdOan2adlJyy</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

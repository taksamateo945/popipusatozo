He was a leader in the federal response to HIV/Aids and other infectious diseases even before coronavirus hit.</p><p>“I will be leaving these positions in December of this year to pursue the next chapter of my career,” Fauci said in a statement, calling those roles “the honour of a lifetime”.</p><p>Fauci became the face of the US government response to Covid-19 as it hit in early 2020, with frequent appearances on television news and at daily press conferences with White House officials, including then-President Donald Trump. But as the pandemic deepened, Fauci fell out of favour with Trump and his officials when his urgings of continued public caution clashed with the former president’s desire to return to normalcy and to promote unproven therapies for the virus.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/XqkIXeCC_y7UCk7mG9ePT74pj_g=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/XZJ3UU7JORNETYUXSLJYGH6FAA.jpg"><p>Fauci found himself marginalised by the Trump administration, increasingly kept out of major decisions about the federal response, but continued to speak out publicly in media interviews, advocating social distancing and face coverings in public settings before the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines.</p><p>He was also the subject of political attacks and death threats and was granted a security detail for his protection.</p><p>When Biden entered the White House, he asked Fauci to stay on in his administration in an elevated capacity. The President praised Fauci in a statement, saying, “Whether you’ve met him personally or not, he has touched all Americans’ lives with his work. I extend my deepest thanks for his public service. The United States of America is stronger, more resilient, and healthier because of him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/H4t8XdG6Hpo-qkUhper8v8Il88I=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/GF6BRHFX4RWE7HBNMYGK3KL6UU.jpg"><p>Fauci said despite retiring from federal service he planned to continue working.</p><p>“I want to use what I have learned as NIAID Director to continue to advance science and public health and to inspire and mentor the next generation of scientific leaders as they help prepare the world to face future infectious disease threats,” he said. <i>– AP</i></p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-world">Related articles</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKS9bsHSZqCnnpWYwaq71KxknaGjmq60sYyer6mdoql6pb6MmqWtoJ%2Bjxm6ywK6aomWkpHqzsdOiqZ5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

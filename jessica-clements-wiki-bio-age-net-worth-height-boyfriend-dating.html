Her family always had birds in their house. She used to go with them to the pet store to buy food and toys for their birds, and in the store she fell in love with an Amazon parrot. Sadly, when they finally decided to buy him, they found out that somebody had already bought it. Then a few years later, just as in the movies, Picasso found his way to her. The owners of the parrot brought him to Jessica’s parents because they heard her family shelters “problem birds”. Apparently, they didn’t treat him right, and therefore he was kind of disobedient. Well, it was great because he was reunited with Jessica and the two of them became instant friends.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy bird day ? <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/b8SL3HglAz</a></p><p>— Jessica Clements (@jclements43) <a rel=nofollow href=#>January 5, 2017</a></p><h2><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span></h2><p>We know that Jessica was dating <a rel=nofollow href=#>Erik Conover</a> – a YouTube star – from 2012 for four years before they split in 2016.

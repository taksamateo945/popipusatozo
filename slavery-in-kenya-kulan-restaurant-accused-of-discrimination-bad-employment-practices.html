I wish that you may highlight this toxic work environment.
Imagine a world of 2 sets of human beings.
This is the story of Kulan Cuisine a Somali restaurant in Nairobi.
I have been a customer of Kulan Cuisine for a short while now. This started when a friend got a position and prompted me to dine there.
The Somali owner restaurant employs Kenyans who are subtly discriminated."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In short, a certified cook takes instructions from any Somali be it the cashier, store keeper or the kitchen supervisor all who are not chefs by any standard.</li><li>This is very unprofessional and a huge demotivator to serious professional.</li><li>Imagine having to follow an order from some whose rank is granted by ethnicity.</li><li>The waiters are in the same dilemma and so are the rest of Kenyan staff.</li><li>There is no disciplinary action against Somali misconduct.</li><li>They are frequently late and maybe abusive and aggressive towards other staff.</li><li>They have been cases of Kenyans facing abusive language and no action is taken.</li><li>Kenyans often resign due to frustration and abusive language.</li><li>The staff are employed on contract and thus dismissal is in the spot. The fight is your wits against the word of a Somali. As such the Kenyans fear the Somalis as they want to keep there Job.</li><li>There has been a case of a Somali staff hurling a knife as he didn’t like how he was served by fellow staff. This is how abbrasive things can be at Kulan.</li><li>The employer has no concern for staff welfare and consistently delays salary causing fights with landlords and caretakers. Pleas are not heeded</li><li>The owners also have a white friend by the name Nick who is known to be abusive to staff and smokes in the premises, causing discomfort to the staff</li><li>The Kenyan staff are provided for a meal of ugali, sukuma for lunch and tea and bread.</li><li>The Somali can, however, enjoy any meal from the menu at any time for free, this is another case of subtle discrimination. The staff can’t even have water from a glass, just tap water is allowed using plastic cups.</li><li>There NHIF and NSSF often go unpaid despite it being deducted and essential for healthcare. Lea is most likely not remitted (not sure).</li><li>This is just a snippet of what my friend who recently left narrated to me. More could be happening and I hope authorities investigate.</li><li>If you visit you will clearly see what I talk about, demotivated people in a toxic environment.</li><li>Please reach out to current and former staff and they will collaborate this.</li><p>Slavery In Kenya: <a href=#>Click to READ MORE</a></p><p><strong>We reach out to former and current staff.

A video went viral over the weekend of Harvey chatting with Jay at Roc Nation’s The Brunch, which occurred Saturday ahead of the Grammys that Sunday. During the star-studded event, Harvey made time to catch up with the rapper and fans took issue with her apparently flirtatious response to his statement.
It’s not clear what Jay said, but Harvey tilted her head ever so slightly and said, “thank you."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You really think she tried to flirt with jay z on camera with folks right there who could hear everything???”</p><p>The BeyHive’s concerns may stem from Harvey publicly playing the field lately. The star was elevated into the viral stratosphere last week after she deleted a photo on her Instagram page with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Trey Songz</strong></a>, whom she had gone official with. However, after a woman flirted with Songz in a club over Super Bowl weekend, Harvey dumped him. Not long after, she was caught making out with five-time championship winning Formula 1 race car driver&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong></a>. She was also seen partying it up with&nbsp;Diddy’s son&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Justin Combs</a></strong>&nbsp;and the rapper-mogul’s&nbsp;surrogate son&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Quincy Brown</strong></a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Harvey has shuttered her Instagram comments and let folks know she’s also a fan of Bey.</p><p>“Meanwhile I’m part of the Beyhive 😩😂,” she said on the social media site.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/lori-harvey-beyhive.png alt="lori harvey" width=514 height=63 sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Now Lori you don’t want these problems.. you better turn that head right side up <a href=#>#loriharvey</a> <a href=#>#jayz</a> <a href=#>#beyonce</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EJf32xJ2FW</a></p><p>— beni the dancer (@BeniDance) <a href=#>February 10, 2019</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX56e49rZmppX522t7GMpqCnnF2Xsrq7zZycrGWWlru0edKwmKulXaG8s7WMoZirrpWueqe70WabmqqZo7RuwM5mqqahnJp6osCMo5iyZapk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

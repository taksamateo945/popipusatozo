Kelly just lost one of his girlfriends. Reported first by Page Six, the outlet claims Azriel Clary moved out of Kelly’s apartment in Trump Tower, New York. Clary had been living with Kelly and his other girlfriend, Joycelyn Savage.</p><p>A source who spoke with the aforementioned outlet claims Clary was tired of the continuous scandals and neverending problems. As it was previously reported, prosecutors in Chicago accused the singer-songwriter of bribing an Illinois government official so he could marry Aaliyah, when she was just 15-years-old. She died in 2001.</p><p>Furthermore, the insider claims the young woman is on her way to Chicago to work as a model and singer. As it was previously reported by Fox News, the star was accused of creating a fake ID for a woman just before he tried to marry Aaliyah in 1994, leading most publications to suggest it was, in fact, the iconic singer.</p><p>Filed earlier this Thursday in the Big Apple, the indictment accused Kelly of paying an official for a fake ID document for someone identified as “Jane Doe,” on the 30th of August, 1994 coincidentally, the day before Mr. Kelly tried to marry Aaliyah when he was 27-years-old.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv7sD-mHJMQ/</p><p>As the story goes, the parents of the iconic singer, who passed away in a tragic plane crash in 2001, annulled the marriage due to the fact she wasn’t of legal age yet, and they were her guardians at that time. This marks the first time Kelly has been held legally responsible for the marriage he was involved in all those years ago.</p><p>As followers of the case know, Mr. Kelly has been slapped with very serious charges in the last year and a half, including sexual exploitation, forced labor, kidnapping, and racketeering. Prosecutors additionally stated that Kelly and his team of associates regularly picked out women and minors at concerts for him to exploit and abuse.</p><p>This wouldn’t be the first time Mr. Kelly has been accused of such crimes. Back in 2008, Kelly was acquitted on charges of videotaping himself having sexual intercourse with a minor. Prosecutors alleged she was 13-years-old.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Regarding his relationship with Aaliyah, Kelly and his lawyers have repeatedly stated over the years that he was not aware of Aaliyah’s actual age. Kelly played a role in the production and writing of Aaliyah’s ironically titled record, Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number, in 1994.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeiYrimuMuyqmafmae5p77InqWdZZ2kw6a%2FjKisrWWfm3qptdJmq6utnaV6tbvWnqlmm5%2BjsbB5km1vbm1nZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

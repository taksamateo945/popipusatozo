Jennifer was married to her ex-husband actor <strong>Brad Pitt</strong>. The two met in 1994 and <a href=# rel=noopener>started</a> dating in 1998. The infatuated couple made their red carpet debut at the 51st Primetime Emmy Awards in September 1999, not long after going on their first date. Brad got down on one knee after their brief romance in 1999, one year after they started dating. The couple got married in 2000, holding a spectacular ceremony in Malibu and had 200 guests and a picture-perfect view of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Before Brad began work on Mr. and Mrs. with Hollywood starlet <strong>Angelina Jolie</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@angelinajolie</a>) in May 2004, when allegations of the Babylon actor's infidelity started to surface, everything seemed to be going perfectly for the newlyweds, and Jennifer even revealed to Vogue Magazine that she was ready to welcome a baby into their lives. The tragic news that the couple was divorcing after nearly five years of marriage was announced in January 2005. The couple said in a joint statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>US Weekly</a> stating;</p><p><strong>We would like to announce that after seven years together, we have chosen to formally separate, We would want to clarify for those who are interested in these things that none of the rumors that have been reported by the tabloid media are the cause of our separation.</strong></p><p>Jennifer and Brad have maintained their friendship even after getting divorced in October 2005. From co-stars to husband and wife, Jennifer Aniston and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Justin Theroux</strong></a> have created a great life in Bel Air. <strong>Ben Stiller</strong> introduced the two in 2007, as Jennifer and Ben had been close friends for a long time and Justin and Ben both co-wrote the movie Tropic Thunder. But the affair took off in 2011 when they also acted in the movie Wanderlust together. In August 2012, while the couple was visiting New York, Justin proposed to her on her 41st birthday. A huge round diamond and a beautiful golden band made up Jennifer's engagement ring.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/03/jennifer-aniston-boyfriend-2023-2.jpg alt="Jennifer Aniston married her boyfriend Justin Theroux, but their marriage ended in divorce." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong><span>Jennifer Aniston</span> married her boyfriend Justin Theroux, but their marriage ended in divorce.<br><strong>Image Source: E Online</strong><br></strong></p><p>The couple was married in August 2015, three years after becoming engaged. They decided to surprise all of their guests by getting married there, and they pretended it was a birthday party for them. The pair decided to call it quits and publicly announce their divorce in February 2018. The former couple emphasized that the separation was amicable in a joint statement.</p><p><strong>Daniel McDonald</strong>, a fellow actor with whom Jennifer dated from 1990 to 1995, was affectionately referred to as her first love in an emotional 2015 interview with The New York Times. Also, she dated her then boyfriend <strong>Paul Rudd</strong>. For many years, the co-stars were very quiet about their alleged romance, but Jennifer ultimately admitted that they had a fling together when we were, like, 12 -- who would have thought!</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><strong>Tate Donovan</strong>, who played the charming Joshua on Friends, was her longest-lasting relationship co-star. On their first anniversary, the couple exchanged Irish engagement rings, and on Valentine's Day, as a sweet gesture for his beloved, he gave her a puppy named Enzo. After three years together, the couple broke up. She then began dating David. When Jennifer Aniston and <strong>David Schwimmer</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@_schwim_</a>) outed a long-kept secret—that they had been in love with each other while working on Friends—in 2021, it sent fans into a tailspin.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/03/jennifer-aniston-boyfriend-2023-3.jpg alt="Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler share a close friendship but are not in a relationship." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong><span>Jennifer Aniston</span> and <span>Adam Sandler share a close friendship but are not in a relationship.<br>Image Source: Instagram</span></strong></p><p>While promoting Murder Mystery 2&nbsp;on Netflix, the actress discussed her friendship with her co-star in detail.

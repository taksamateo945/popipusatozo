Someone conservative is someone that has traditional values and ideas. A conservative character is wary of innovation.</p><p>For example, a conservative person may not believe in separation, abortion, or other controversial arguments. A conservative person is typically very contrary to change.</p><p>People worldwide have contradictory beliefs and values, and many of these people are more mythical. However, it isn’t easy to measure exactly how many conservatives exist around the world. Studies, reports, and research stated which countries are the most conservative. Pakistan has been deemed the most conservative nation on the planet. This data reveals that this country has the widest gender gap and worked poorly in corruption and education access to an individual. Another one of the world’s most conservative countries is Ethiopia. Ethiopia scored low in advanced schooling and gender parity. It was affirmed to be one of the least sophisticated and growing countries in the world. Ranked third, Iran is added to one of the world’s most conservative countries. It ranked poorly in personal rights and gender parity.</p><p><strong>What is Conservatism?</strong></p><p>Conservatism is a social and political philosophy promoting traditional and social institutions. The central principles of conservatism may vary concerning the traditional values or practices of the culture and civilization in which it appears.</p><p><strong>Which countries are socially most conservative?</strong></p><p>Yemen is the most socially conservative country in the world. Child marriage is very common in Yemen.</p><p>So this list is of the ten most conservative nations based on the data compiled:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>10.

It is home to 1.1 million people. Due to poor personal rights, shelter, water sanitation, and personal safety, the tiny African nation’s record on the Social Progress Index was low compared to nations with a similar GDP per capita like Morocco and the Philippines. The majority of people live on government-owned Swazi National Lands, often smaller than one hectare in size. On the other hand, individuals receive vital investment and produce significant Swazi exports like sugar and wood. As per the Centers for Disease Control, Swaziland has one of the grossest rates of HIV/AIDS in the world. This leaves nearly 45% of children orphaned and helpless. HIV affects 26% of those between the ages of 15 and 49, greatly reducing the country’s human resources and <a href=#>life expectancy</a>, approximately 49 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/swaziland.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>9.

The bulk of Lebanese have been seized by armed conflict; those with direct personal expertise include 75% of the people, and most others report flagging a range of hardships. In total, nearly the entire population (96%) has been influenced in some way – either personally or because of the wider outcomes of armed conflict.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/lebanon.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>8.

Also, it scored badly on personal rights, water sanitation,&nbsp; safety, and LGBT tolerance in the Social Progress Index. The nation even passed a law making homosexuality a criminal offense in December 2016. Chad has over 200 distinct ethnic groups, which create diverse social structures. In southern Chad, bitter land disputes are becoming more and more common. They frequently turn violent. Long-standing association culture is being eroded, and so is the subsistence of many farmers. The Chadian government has actively promoted Chadian culture and national traditions by opening the Chad National Museum and the Chad Cultural Centre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/refugee-camp-chad.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>7.

On top of this, it attained 174th out of 180 nations in the environmental Performance Index, making it the second least growing, tolerant and eco-friendly country in the world. Due to a backlash toward the northern population after independence, Mali is now in a situation where it’s all ethnic groups complain about discrimination against the other group. This disagreement also plays a role in the progressive Northern Mali battle. There is tension between Tuaregs and the Malian government and the Tuaregs and radical Islamists who are trying to establish sharia law.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/mali.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>6.

Health care services are especially scarce in rural areas. Only 25 percent of rural districts are covered by health services than 80 percent of urban areas. Saudi Arabia had been driving a Western-backed military alliance, including the United Arab Emirates as a key member, mediated in Yemen in 2015 to restore the government’s ousted power by the Houthi movement. The United Nations described Yemen’s situation, where the war killed tens of thousands of characters and left millions on the verge of starvation, as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/yemen.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>5.

Personal liberties are also low in the Social Progress Index, with Saudi Arabia scoring just 9.1 out of 100 in the category. The state has drawn criticism for a variety of reasons, including its role in the Yemeni <a href=#>Civil War</a>, failure to adopt adequate measures against human trafficking, sponsorship of Islamic terrorism, and its poor human rights record, which has been identified by the lack of women’s rights, excessive and often extrajudicial use of first punishment, state-sponsored discrimination toward religious minorities and atheists, state-sanctioned prejudice and antisemitism, and its strict version of Shari’a law.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/saudi-arabia.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>4.

This, combined with an extremely low personal liberties score in the Social Progress Index, gets it the third most traditional country in the world. All broadcasting from Iranian soil is controlled by the state and reflects official ideology. A wider range of opinions may be found online and in the printed press. However, many pro-reform outlets have been closed and their writers and editors imprisoned. Media freedom advocates have described Iran as “among the five biggest prisons globally” for journalists. The politics of Iran take place in a framework that officially combines elements of theocracy and presidential democracy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iran.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>3.

It is also in the base 15 of the countries in the Gender Gap Report. Egypt was an early and major center of Christianity but was principally Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim nation, with a significant Christian minority. In September 2018, Egypt ratified the law granting authorities the right to monitor social media users to tighten internet controls.

Pakistan is the only nation to have been created in the name of Islam. It also ranked badly in the Environmental Performance Index, ranking 144th out of 180 nations surveyed. Civil society in Pakistan is largely hierarchical, emphasizing local cultural etiquette and traditional Islamic values that govern personal and political life. The private print media, Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), and state-owned Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV), for radio, were the powerful media outlets until the 21st century.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pakistan.jpg><p><strong>Conclusion!</strong></p><p>To create this list of the most conservative countries globally, we compiled this data from three studies. The studies used to select this list are incorporated with the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Report, the Environmental Performance Index, and the Social Progress Index.

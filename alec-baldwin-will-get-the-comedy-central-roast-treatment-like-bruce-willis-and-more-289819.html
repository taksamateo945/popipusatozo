There’s no question that Alec Baldwin will do well on the set, as he is more than familiar with sketch comedy and other forms of stand-up.</p><p>In the aforementioned statement above, Alec stated that he has hosted Saturday Night Live a whopping seventeen times, so there’s no question that he’s great at making jokes as well as being on the butt-end of them as well.</p><p>Regarding the content of the Roast, there’s no doubt that comedians and writers will take aim at the fact Alec was recently charged with harassment in relation to a recent incident in which he fought with a man over a parking lot spot in New York.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>After the media reports came out, Alec criticized them and said much of it was misinformation and sensationalized. The man involved in the altercation later filed a lawsuit, which the actor’s attorney described as a chance at a free “lottery ticket.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRobKkecGao52vmaN6uLXLpWSgnaRiwamxjJympp2Urnqksc2tqZqkXae8or%2FTZqurnZGpuqa602ajoqOVYq%2BzwcKeZLChnKG2tHnAp5tmpZ%2Bnsm5%2Bl3JvanFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

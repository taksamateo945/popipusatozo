Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Tiffani Thiessen, Mario Lopez and more Saved by the Bell stars have gone on to do great things, but they have also stayed true to their roots.
The sitcom, which aired four seasons from 1989 to 1993, followed a group of teens, including Gosselaar, Thiessen, Lopez, Elizabeth Berkley, Dustin Diamond and Lark Voorhies, as they navigated the ups and downs of high school.
Several members of the cast subsequently moved on to the spinoff Saved by the Bell: The College Years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But that’s not to say it’s not open for the future, not knowing what stories will be or anything for a cameo maybe.”</p><p>Several months later, news broke that Diamond had cancer.

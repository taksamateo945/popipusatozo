LeBron “Bronny” James Jr, the eldest son of the legendary three-time NBA champion<a href=#> LeBron James,</a> knows this all too well. James Jr. currently plays as a guard for California’s Sierra Canyon High School and though he is only a 15-year-old freshman, he is a skilled and talented basketball player in his own right. Bronny has no shortage of potential and even <a href=#>drew the attention</a> of five-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, who said that Bronny could be “just as good as his dad or a little better.” Here are five questions and answers about Bronny James.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3nrJ0lBPPX/</p><p>1. How tall is Bronny James?</p><p>Bronny’s height and weight are listed at 6’4″ and 176 pounds. Though Bronny is not as tall as his 6’9″, 250 pound physical beast of a dad, his size is good for his age and position. In any case, Bronny is still growing, so he may end up reaching between 6’6″ and 6’8″ when he reaches adulthood.</p><p>2. What is Bronny James’ ranking?</p><p>According to a <a href=#>list of the Top 50 players of the Class of 2023 by Nothing But Net Magazine</a>, Bronny James is ranked no. 15. However, rankings are a bit subjective, as Bronny was also ranked <a href=#>25th on Coast2Coast Prep’s high school senior Class of 2023 list in 2018</a>, not as high as his father would have liked.</p><p>3. Does Bronny James shoot better than his father?</p><p>He does, according to LeBron James himself. In 2019, ESPN National Recruiting Director <a href=#>Paul Biancardi said on Twitter</a> that Bronny’s jump shot was better than his dad’s. <a href=#>LeBron James agreed with him</a>, saying that both Bronny and his second son Bryce Maximus have better jump shots than him.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B3TDs5DBByL/</p><p>4. Has Bronny James received any college scholarship offers?</p><p>Bronny has received scholarship offers and has drawn interest from many schools. In January 2020,<a href=#> North Carolina Central University (NCCU) offered James Jr. a scholarship</a>. More recently, James Jr. received an offer from Kentucky, with Duke, Kansas, North Carolina and UCLA all showing interest, <a href=#>as reported by 247sports</a>. In fact, Bronny has been receiving college letters and scholarship offers since he was 10-years-old, <a href=#>which drew the ire of his famous father</a>, who said: “It should be a violation. You shouldn’t be recruiting 10-year-old kids.”</p><p>5. Why doesn’t Bronny James wear his father’s number?</p><p>Bronny currently wears no. 0 as a member of Sierra Canyon. LeBron James mentioned in a <a href=#>2015 Sports Illustrated interview</a> that Bronny refuses to wear his numbers (no. 23 or no. 6 as a Miami Heat player) because “he doesn’t want people to know who he is.” Considering the fact that his name is literally LeBron James Jr, going incognito may be a bit difficult for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWlmaWxfZYZwrtGopaexXZ%2BurrHSZp%2BeoZedwW7DxKKeoaxdlrSmedCunKysmaS7tHnAp6qwnaKasXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

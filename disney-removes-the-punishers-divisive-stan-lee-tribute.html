However, in 2018, Disney/Marvel Studios ended their relationship with Netflix and ABC, resulting in the cancellation of&nbsp;The Punisher&nbsp;and all the other shows in the Defenders&nbsp;universe. Now, every season of&nbsp;The Punisher,&nbsp;Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, and The Defenders&nbsp;has become available to stream on Disney+.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><a href=#>Marvel legend Stan Lee</a> passed away at the age of 95 on November 12, 2018. Shortly after his death,&nbsp;The Punisher’s second and final season became available on Netflix. The final episode of season 2, “The Whirlwind,” ended with a comic-book accurate Castle using assault rifles to “punish” a group of drug dealers/criminals inside of a warehouse. Right before the credits rolled a slide read “In Loving Memory of Stan Lee”—which some felt was in bad taste considering the series’ violent end.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Punisher Wasn’t In The Defenders (& Why The Snub Was Right)</a></span></p><p>Disney+ has removed the Stan Lee tribute from&nbsp;The Punisher’s season 2 finale. That said, the Stan Lee tribute at the end of&nbsp;Jessica Jones&nbsp;season 2 remains. However, the streaming service has also removed a&nbsp;Luke Cage&nbsp;tribute honoring the late Reg E. Cathey, who played Reverend James Lucas, the father of the eponymous hero.</p><figure class=item-img></figure><p>This news comes just days after fans noticed Disney <a href=#>censored scenes in&nbsp;The Falcon and the Winter Solider</a>, making them less violent and more suitable for younger audiences. While Disney/Marvel Studios has not commented on the matter, a source at Disney has said that the scenes will be restored to their original version. Regardless, it’s clear Disney+ is making some changes. As reports of a&nbsp;Daredevil&nbsp;reboot swirl and Disney+ adds parental controls to allow for shows like&nbsp;The Punisher&nbsp;to coexist alongside its family-friendly material.</p><p>Last year, Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock and Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin made appearances in MCU projects&nbsp;Spider-Man: No Way Home&nbsp;and Disney+’s&nbsp;Hawkeye, respectively. Ever since, fans have wondered if other previously-Netflix characters like Punisher, <a href=#>Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter)</a>, Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) would also be implemented. The success of&nbsp;The Defenders&nbsp;Saga on Disney+ is essentially a litmus test for the future of these characters and viewership has been solid, with many discovering shows like&nbsp;<strong>The Punisher&nbsp;</strong>for the first time. That said, tributes being removed from the updated versions remains a curious decision.</p><p><span class=next-single>More: <a href=#>Will Marvel Netflix Actors Return In The MCU?

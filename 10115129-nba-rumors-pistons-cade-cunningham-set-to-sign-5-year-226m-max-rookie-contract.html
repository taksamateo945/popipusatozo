That left Detroit with a decision, which wasn't necessarily as easy as it seemed on the surface.</p><p>On the one hand, Cunningham is a franchise player and the No. 1 overall pick of the 2021 NBA draft who has shown far more than just flashes of excellence during the early portion of his career.</p><p>He has looked like a building block for years to come, which is underscored by the decision to sign him to an extension.</p><p>On the other hand, Cunningham's presence hasn't exactly led to many wins. The Pistons went 23-59 in his rookie season, 17-65 in his second season and 14-68 in his third.</p><p>Detroit could have waited before finalizing a new deal down the line since he was still previously under contract until the summer of 2025. Even then, he would have been a restricted free agent, meaning the team could have matched any offers and kept him on the roster.</p><p>The Pistons' front office still had plenty of team control and didn't necessarily need to rush into a decision.</p><p>Still, this gives a franchise that has struggled for years something to rally around moving forward.</p><p>Cunningham has shown steady improvement through his three seasons in the league, and the 2023-24 one was his best individual effort. He averaged 22.7 points, 7.5 assists and 4.3 rebounds per game while shooting 44.9 percent from the field and 35.5 percent from deep.</p><p>The points, assists, field-goal percentage and three-point percentage were all career-best numbers.</p><p>There might finally be some reason for optimism in Detroit, as Cunningham is just 22 years old. What's more, Jaden Ivey—the No. 5 overall pick of the 2022 draft—is also 22, while Jalen Duren—the No. 13 overall pick of the 2022 draft—is just 20.</p><p>Cunningham is now with the Pistons for the long run and will look to reestablish the only NBA team he has ever known as a winner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWp%2Bc4WMp5maZaKqurC%2B0manoqukpLu0ecKam55lk6q7r7XNoJ%2BapV2osrV506hkrKGXo3p2ediemKtlYmeDrnnMmq9mqp%2BkuKqxjJymp6yilrC1</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

Because I’m the oldest, my father would always tell me [that] I have to make sure that the group is taken care of and that I have to be the leader and lead by example. But, after his passing, and us being thrown into the ‘real world,’ my siblings honestly—they picked up the slack that I unfortunately left behind.”</p><p>Prince continued:</p><p>“Any moment I get to spend with my siblings now, especially as we’re getting older and our own lives are starting to kind of blossom and grow-</p><p>“Every moment that I get with them—any little family dinner, any little family outing—is really a special moment for me.”</p><p>Aside from being incredibly close, Prince and Paris have also worked together on music.

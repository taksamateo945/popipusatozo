Cecil Newton, and another person, referred to as an owner of a scouting service in the NCAA statement, tried to market Newton "as a part of a pay-for-play scenario in return for Newton's commitment to attend college and play football," the NCAA said.

"Based on the information available to the reinstatement staff at this time, we do not have sufficient evidence that Cam Newton or anyone from Auburn was aware of this activity, which led to his reinstatement."</p><p>Auburn's football team is undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the BCS poll, thanks largely to Newton's running and passing, but pay-to-play allegations have dogged the team all season. Auburn faces South Carolina in the Southeastern Conference matchup on Saturday.</p><p class=cnnInline>"The conduct of Cam Newton's father and the involved individual is unacceptable and has no place in the SEC or in intercollegiate athletics," said Mike Slive, Southeastern Conference commissioner. "The actions taken by Auburn University and Mississippi State University make it clear this behavior will not be tolerated in the SEC."</p><p class=cnn_strycbftrtxt><b>CNN's Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report</b></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/misc/advertisement.gif width=58 height=5 alt border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/misc/advertisement.gif width=58 height=5 alt border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZp6cmam2sLqNnKWnZpOkunB%2Bj2pnaIuAhJ%2BVe5BrZmlpX5bCo8HRp2WnnaepvK97yKebnrBencGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
